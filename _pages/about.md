**Howdy, folks -** 

I'm CJ Taylor, an [`unbridled spirit`](https://kentucky.gov/about/pages/unbridledspirit.aspx) in The Bluegrass State of Kentucky. I've been playing digital [`LEGO`](https://www.lego.com/en-us) in Software Engineering since 2010 in a variety of roles and spend most of my time these days in [`Amazon Web Services`](https://aws.amazon.com/).

I'm a [`Principal Platform Engineer`](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/02/13/setting-the-stage-for-platform-engineering/) at Churchill Downs doing what I can for the Kentucky Derby with software.

I'm a glutton for solving problems and helping others pick up strategies or technologies to ease their workflows. I hope to make this place a treasure trove for those looking to know what I'm up to, researching, or hackin' on.

I hope you enjoy what wacky bits get stashed here over time, and if you'd like to chat, feel free to reach out!

**Cheers,**

**CJ Taylor - Bluegrass Dev**
